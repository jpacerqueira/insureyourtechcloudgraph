# Cloud Insurance Risk Ratings API

## Overview

This API provides risk ratings for cloud providers based on various factors such as outages, security incidents, and compliance issues. It uses a combination of machine learning models and expert systems to generate risk ratings.

## Deployment

The API is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory will build and run the API container.

## Usage

To run the API, navigate to the root directory and run `docker compose up`. This will build and run the API container.

## API Endpoints

The API has the following endpoints:

- `GET /cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings`: Get the risk ratings for all cloud providers.
- `GET /cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/{provider}`: Get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider.
- `GET /cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/outages/{provider}`: Get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider and metric.
- `GET /cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/services/sla/{provider}`: Get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider and metric.
- `GET /cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/services/risk.ratings/{provider}`: Get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider and metric.


## Example Usage

To obtain a sample of all services and of all Outages from the Fremium API

```bash

    ```

To get the risk ratings for all cloud providers, you can make a GET request to the `/cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings` endpoints , as examples below.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings
    ``` 

To get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider, you can make a GET request to the `/cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/{provider}` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/aws
```


To get the risk ratings for a specific cloud provider and metric, you can make a GET request to the `/risk-ratings/{provider}/{metric}` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/cloud-services-risk-ratings/risk-ratings/provider/outages/aws
```

An Example of the CSV data can be found in the `csv-loader` directory.

```bash
 head -n 2000000 ../information/datamodel/cloud-risk-datamodel-services-above-sla-outage.csv > data/cloud_service_risk_ratings.csv
 docker compose up --build
```

To rebuild the API without running it, use the following command, option 3:

```bash
 bash -x build-api-cluster 3
```
